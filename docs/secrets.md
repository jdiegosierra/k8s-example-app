# Managing Secrets with Sealed Secrets

## Overview

While the current project uses standard Kubernetes Secrets, I recommend using Sealed Secrets for enhanced security. Sealed Secrets is a Kubernetes controller and tool for one-way encrypted Secrets.

## Current Implementation

In the project, I am currently using standard Kubernetes Secrets. Here's an example of how I manage secrets:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: app-secret
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
data:
  api-key: <base64-encoded-value>
```

## Recommended Approach: Sealed Secrets

For detailed information about Sealed Secrets implementation, please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets).

### Best Practices

- Always specify the namespace when creating Sealed Secrets
- Use descriptive names for secrets
- Limit access to the Sealed Secrets controller
- Implement a process for regular secret rotation
- Ensure Sealed Secrets are backed up along with other Kubernetes resources
- Ensure the Sealed Secrets controller's private key is backed up securely
- Restrict access to the Sealed Secrets controller
- Use RBAC to control access to secrets
