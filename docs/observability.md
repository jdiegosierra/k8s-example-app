# Kubernetes Observability

## Overview

This example application serves as a basic Kubernetes deployment without specific observability tools. In a production environment, it's essential to implement proper monitoring and observability solutions to ensure system reliability and performance.

## Recommended Production Tools

For production environments, consider implementing the following observability tools:

### Metrics Collection
- **Prometheus**: Industry-standard metrics collection and storage
- **Alertmanager**: Prometheus' alerting system for handling alerts, deduplication, grouping, and routing
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboarding for metrics

### Logging
- **Elasticsearch**: Distributed search and analytics engine
- **Kibana**: Data visualization and exploration for Elasticsearch
- **Fluentd/Fluent Bit**: Log collection and forwarding
- **Loki**: Log aggregation system designed for Kubernetes

### Distributed Tracing
- **OpenTelemetry**: Vendor-neutral observability framework
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing system

### Log and Trace Correlation
- **Elastic Stack (ELK)**: End-to-end log and trace correlation using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Unified collection of logs, metrics, and traces
- **Grafana Tempo**: Distributed tracing backend that can be integrated with logs and metrics
